#INPUT FILE STRUCTURE
#beta - entanglement activity (1 for CFSM), roughly the number of Kuhn segments between entanglements
#architecture - only 'linear' is currently available, 'linear' uses analytical expressions for p_cd(tau) statistics
#NK - total number of Kuhn steps in chain
#Nchains - number of chains in the ensemble
#flow - 
    #flag - True/False to turn on/off flow
    #type - constant or oscillation
    #kappa - strain-rate tensor [kxx, kxy, kxz, kyx, kyy, kyz, kzx, kzy, kzz], for oscillatory shear, it becomes strain-rate amplitude (strain = kappa/freq.*sin(freq.*t))
    #flow_time - length of simulation to turn flow on (set to 0 < flow_time < sim_time to turn off flow during simulation)
#CD_flag - turn on constraint dynamics (0 is off, 1 is on)
#PD_flag - use polydispersity in ensemble (currently not available)
#EQ_calc - options: stress or msd, determines whether G(t) or MSD is calculated
#tau_K - time step resolution for stress calculation, minimum value is 1
#sim_time: total simulation time (tau_K)
